# Industrial-Training-Program--Real-Useful-Life-of-a-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell
This repository contains the implementation, results, and report for the project **"Lifecycle Management of Renewable Energy Storage System"** focused on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) using LSTM and other machine learning algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) offer a clean energy solution but suffer from degradation over time. This project applies data-driven models, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the degradation and estimate RUL from static and quasi-dynamic operational datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Process and clean fuel cell datasets using condensation and filtering
- Extract relevant features via PCA and correlation analysis
- Predict stack voltage using Linear Regression, SVM, ANN, and LSTM
- Estimate RUL using predicted degradation trends
- Compare performance across models using key evaluation metrics
